# Product Requirements Document: React Native Mobile App Conversion

## 1. Introduction/Overview

**Campus Connect Mobile** is a React Native mobile application that brings the full Campus Connect experience to iOS and Android devices. This project involves converting the existing Next.js web application into a native mobile app while maintaining full feature parity with all 24 feature categories.

### Problem Statement
Students currently access Campus Connect through a web browser, which lacks the native mobile experience benefits such as push notifications, offline access, faster performance, and seamless device integration. A native mobile app will provide students with instant access to their campus ecosystem directly from their phones.

### Project Scope
Convert the entire Campus Connect Next.js web application to React Native, targeting both iOS and Android platforms, while sharing the existing Supabase backend infrastructure.

---

## 2. Goals

1. **Full Feature Parity**: Implement all 24 feature categories from the web app in the mobile version
2. **Cross-Platform Support**: Single codebase that runs on both iOS and Android
3. **Native Experience**: Leverage native device capabilities (push notifications, camera, biometrics, haptics)
4. **Performance**: Achieve smooth 60fps animations and fast load times
5. **Offline Support**: Enable core features to work without internet connectivity
6. **Shared Backend**: Utilize the existing Supabase database and authentication system
7. **Maintainability**: Create a clean, modular architecture that's easy to extend

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **Web App Modifications**: The existing Next.js web app will remain unchanged

3. **Payment Processing**: In-app payments for tuition or services
4. **Social Media Integration**: Sharing to external social platforms
5. **Wearable Support**: Apple Watch or Android Wear apps
6. **Tablet-Optimized UI**: While the app will work on tablets, no tablet-specific layouts
7. **Widget Support**: Home screen widgets (can be added in future phases)
8. **Backend Admin Panel**: Admin features for managing content

---

## 6. Design Considerations

### Visual Design
- Maintain consistency with the web app's blue & white professional theme
- Use the existing color palette defined in `globals.css`
- Adapt CSS Module styles to React Native StyleSheet/NativeWind

### Component Library Recommendations
- **NativeWind** (TailwindCSS for React Native) or **Tamagui** for styling
- **React Native Paper** or custom components matching web design
- **Lucide React Native** for icons (same as web)
- **Lottie React Native** for animations (same as web)
- **React Native Reanimated** for smooth animations (replacement for Framer Motion)

### Navigation Structure
```
├── (auth)
│   ├── login
│   └── signup
├── (tabs)
│   ├── home (dashboard)
│   ├── events
│   ├── community
│   ├── messages

├── financial/
├── dining/
├── transport/
├── study/
├── ai/
├── career/
├── wellness/
├── achievements/
├── notifications/
└── search/
```

### Screen Mockup References
- Reference existing web app screens at `src/app/dashboard/`
- Adapt layouts for mobile viewport
- Use native mobile patterns (bottom sheets, swipe gestures, pull-to-refresh)

## 7. Technical Considerations

### Recommended Tech Stack

| Category | Technology | Reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Framework | Expo SDK 52+ (managed) | Simplified development, OTA updates, excellent DX |
| Navigation | Expo Router v4 | File-based routing similar to Next.js App Router |
| State Management | React Context + Tanstack Query | Match existing web patterns, excellent caching |
| Backend | Supabase JS Client | Same as web app |
| Realtime | Supabase Realtime | Same as web for messaging |
| Styling | NativeWind (Tailwind) | Consistent with modern RN practices |
| Animations | React Native Reanimated 3 | 60fps animations, gesture support |
| Icons | Lucide React Native | Same icon set as web |
| Storage | Expo SecureStore | Secure token storage |
| Push Notifications | Expo Notifications | Integrated push notification service |

### Shared Code Strategy
```
campus-connect/
├── packages/
│   └── shared/           # Shared TypeScript types, utils, constants
│       ├── types/
│       ├── utils/
│       └── constants/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/              # Existing Next.js app (moved)
│   └── mobile/           # New React Native app
└── package.json          # Monorepo configuration
```

### Key Dependencies (Mobile App)
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "~52.0.0",
    "expo-router": "~4.0.0",
    "react-native": "0.76.x",
    "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.39.1",
    "react-native-reanimated": "~3.16.0",
    "nativewind": "^4.0.0",
    "lottie-react-native": "^6.0.0",

    "expo-notifications": "~0.29.0",
    "expo-local-authentication": "~15.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Environment Configuration
- Use the same Supabase project (shared backend)
- Configure Expo environment variables for Supabase URL and anon key
- Set up EAS Build for app store deployments

### Performance Considerations
- Implement virtualized lists for long scrolling content (FlashList)
- Use image caching and optimization
- Implement proper loading states and skeletons
- Minimize re-renders with proper memoization

## 9. Open Questions

1. **App Store Accounts**: Are Apple Developer ($99/year) and Google Play Developer ($25 one-time) accounts already set up?

2. **Push Notification Server**: Will push notifications be triggered from Supabase Edge Functions, or is a separate notification server needed?

3. **Offline Data Scope**: Which specific data should be cached for offline access? (e.g., last N events, all courses, recent messages)

4. **Deep Linking Domain**: What domain will be used for universal/app links (e.g., `campusconnect.app`)?

5. **Analytics Platform**: Which analytics service should be integrated? (e.g., Mixpanel, Amplitude, PostHog, Expo Analytics)

6. **Beta Testing**: Will TestFlight (iOS) and Google Play Internal Testing be used for beta distribution?

7. **Existing User Migration**: Should there be a campaign to encourage web users to download the mobile app?

8. **Branding Assets**: Are high-resolution app icons and splash screen designs available, or need to be created?
